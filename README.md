# CloneyClip
CloneyClip is an open source alternative to the increasingly rare Killy Clip. This design is simply placed on top of the target chip and clipped into place with the retaining shell.

## Assembly
Instructions for assembly are straightforward — in fact, it's so simple they're marked on the bottom of the PCB.

 1. Insert [Pogo Pins](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FPFBFV3/) from the silkscreened "Cloney Clip".
 2. Apply flux to installed pins and heat with soldering iron at 370° Celsius (700° Fahrenheit).
 3. Attach your wires, insert the assembly [into the shell](http://shpws.me/SInZ), and clip it in place.
